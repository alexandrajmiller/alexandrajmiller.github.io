Hi, I’m Alexandra. My mission is to help you unite your logical mind with your intuitive heart so they can work together — helping you feel alive in your body and in your life.
I found this work through my own challenges in academia. I found it odd that there’s no official course on how to intentionally create a happy life one desires, yet there are entire majors dedicated to building complicated machines.
As a mechanical engineer, my mission was to develop assistive technology to help people live healthier, happier lives. Over time, I realized the most powerful technology isn’t external. It’s internal.
Now, my work is about helping you learn to work with your own technology — your thoughts, emotions, physical body, and, at the root of it all, your personal energy — so that you can move through life with more ease, clarity, and joy.
