Hi Alex. I just want to share what has happened since our time together last night. My headache completely disappeared and by the time I went to bed I had no pain in my liver. Moreover, I felt normal, now this may seem a little mundane, but to someone who has been living with cancer for 4 years, feeling normal is just beautiful! 
 Then to really blow me away, I had a full nights great sleep with no disturbances. I was so amazed when I woke up and realised it was morning. I haven’t had an unbroken nights sleep in months. 
I have been doing the 3 Heart Connection and did one before my treatment. It went well, still no pain and feeling really chipper. 
So thank you my dear friend, you have already made a real impact on me. 
Bless your beautiful soul ❤️
