Hi Alex I had a wonderful nights sleep last night and went to work in the showroom this morning. I was doubtful that I would get through a full day, however my energy seemed to blossom and I had an amazing day. My brain fog also seemed to dissipate as the day went on. Even after 8 hours at work I came home in high spirits and cooked dinner for tonight and tomorrow. Just about to go to sleep. Your healing with me is amazing. Thank you, thank you, thank you 🙏 🙏🙏 Sending you much love.
